# Chapter 3 - Application Requirements

### Business Problem
This application is an Inspector General - Inspection Management System. Inspection is a core mandate of this division and various departments are inspected to see if they are complying with mandates and also to determine if there are any processes they are conducting that are inline with, best practices or outright unsatisfactory in light of the statutes of the government. This application should provide the following outcomes

1. Provide visibility into what is happening in both the pre-inspection and inspection phases of an assessment

2. Enable prework activities to be sent out ahead of time to the inspected party point of contact (POC) to allow the inspection process to better allocate resources based on when the POC and their team are ready

3. Provide a way to enforce and manage pre-inspection tasks
4. Give a better user experience to the process of capturing inspection findings
5. Capture and store all inspection information indefinately
6. Provide a method to quickly template inspections that happen repeatedly


### 1- Business Story
Inspections are performed against departments at different times a year but usually yearly. Some departments may be inspected quarterly or even monthly. Before each inspection is some prework required on the part of the IG and also the inspected department.

* IG Tasks - the IG must
  * Identify which inspection areas apply to the departments
  * Create a list of documents, artifacts and information that will need to be gathered in advance of the inspection
  * Send an information and prework set of tasks to the inspected department ahead of the inspection
  * create a shell report of the inspection before beginning the inspection

* Inspected Department (ID) tasks  
  * the ID must receive a set of pre-work instructions from the IG
  * the ID must act on those tasks in a timely manner and notify the IG of their progress
  * The ID must co-operate in answering the questions and demonstrating proficiency in the items requested by the IG during the inspection.


### 2 - Business outcomes
After an inspection the IG must produced
* Inspection Report - an report summarising the inspection
* Interim Inspection Statuses - a set of one or more summaries of the progress of the inspection while it is ongoing.


### 3 - Implementation
You have been awarded the contract to build this system. However, due to minimal stakeholder availability, you must build the described system in ServiceNow to meet these Requirements
